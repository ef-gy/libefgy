Welcome to libefgy's documentation!
===================================

libefgy is a header-only C++ template library with lots of templates dealing
with maths in all its glory. And a few random other things not directly related
to maths that still come in handy. Unlike other libraries, all of the classes
take the datatype to work on as a template argument and oftentimes the size of
things like vectors and matrices are set at compile time.
