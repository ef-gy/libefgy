/**\file
 * \brief Test cases for the 'optional' template
 *
 * This file contains test cases for the 'optional' template. std::optional
 * is coming up in the next iteration of the C++ standard (C++17) and is
 * currently available in clang when using std=c++14. Or, well, at least an
 * experimental version is.
 *
 * This should replace efgy::maybe, so I've copied the test cases for that and
 * changed them slightly so they work with std::optional.
