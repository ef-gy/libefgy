###- INSTALLATION -###########################################################

This is a header-only C++ template library. As such, installation is rather
simple: just copy the header files (the include/ef.gy directory) to your
compiler's default include path (typically /usr/include).

If you don't want to copy the files yourself, then run the following command
as root:

# make PREFIX=/usr install

Adjust PREFIX as appropriate.
