# libefgy-3: README ##########################################################

libefgy is a header-only C++ template library with lots of templates dealing
with maths in all its glory. And a few random other things not directly
related to maths that still come in handy.

## OBTAINING LIBEFGY #########################################################

The library is distributed free of charge under a very permissive licence. The
public GIT repository is at http://git.becquerel.org/jyujin/libefgy.git - see
the documentation at http://ef.gy/documentation/libefgy for more details.

### MIRRORS ##################################################################

The libefgy source code is mirrored at:

    - https://code.google.com/p/libefgy/

## INSTALLATION ##############################################################

This is a header-only C++ template library. As such, installation is rather
simple: just copy the header files (the include/ef.gy directory) to your
compiler's default include path (typically /usr/include).

If you don't want to copy the files yourself, then run the following command:

    $ sudo make PREFIX=/usr install

Adjust PREFIX as appropriate; substitute sudo when necessary.

## DOCUMENTATION #############################################################

libefgy uses Doxygen - http://www.doxygen.org/ - to document the code right in
the headers themselves. If you're stuck, just open up the header file and read
the documentation there. You can also extract an HTML version of the
documentation from a local source tree by running:

    $ make documentation

This will create or update the documentation in the directory
documentation/html, so that you can then just open the file
documentation/html/index.xhtml in a browser.

The HTML documentation for the current development version is also available
online at: http://ef.gy/documentation/libefgy

## LICENCE ###################################################################

libefgy is distributed under an MIT/X style licence. For all practical intents
and purposes that means that you can do pretty much whatever you want with the
code, except claim that you wrote it yourself, as long as you point out
somewhere in your documentation that you used libefgy.

See the file COPYING in the repository for the exact licence terms.
